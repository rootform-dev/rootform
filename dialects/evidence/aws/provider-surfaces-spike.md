# AWS provider-surfaces spike

## Question

Can exact `hashicorp/aws` `6.62.0` surfaces be inventoried exhaustively while
keeping durable architecture separate from operations, lookups, and queries?

## Verdict

Yes. Terraform `1.12.2` loaded signed provider `6.62.0` without AWS
configuration or credentials. Schema RPC and exact generated source provide a
closed baseline:

| Kind | Count | Architecture treatment |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| managed resource | 1,711 | candidate for rule or explicit decision |
| data source | 679 | read-only lookup; represent only with independent proof |
| ephemeral resource | 10 | non-durable; unmodeled or without representation |
| action | 12 | imperative side effect; never durable entity |
| list resource | 210 | `.tfquery.hcl` discovery/import surface; not source architecture |
| function | 4 | expression helper; no declaration node |
| resource identity | 501 | provider protocol metadata; no declaration node |

Actions are provider-defined side effects and do not modify resource state.
They may support an already modeled owner only through exact accepted owner
resolution. List resources query remote infrastructure for bulk import; current
Rootform source ingestion does not read `.tfquery.hcl`, and query results are
not Terraform source of truth. They remain exhaustive inventory with
`no-rule/query-surface`, not received declaration
`unsupported`.

Compatibility remains exactly `= 6.62.0`: only this schema, source registration,
used paths, and meaning are proven. Exactness is temporary evidence, not a rule
requiring a new dialect for every provider minor.

## Limitations

Schema presence proves shape, not architecture meaning. Case-insensitive macOS
checkout reported testdata path collisions, but exact generated registration
files and Git tree identity remained readable. Compatibility beyond `6.62.0`
needs another path and meaning comparison.
